# Library Quest- A book recommendation adventure game

Characters explore a magic library, meeting mystical characters and traveling through different rooms of the enchanted library. 
Players solve mini puzzles and questions about their book preferences. 
Based on these the game recommends books that match their taste – fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, self-help. 
It is a 2D interactive adventure game that will be built with python and pygame.
