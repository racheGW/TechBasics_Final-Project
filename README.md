# Final Project in Tech Basics 1
# Pastel Pong - A colourful minigame!

Play for hours, against the machine in a pastel coloured void. 
It is a 2D interactive adventure game that will be built with python and pygame. 
The game requires pygame and an updated version of python. 


To play the game, you need the three python files under code, main, setting and sprites. As well as a directionary for data. The game stores its progress therefore a data diretionary is requiered. As an example I added a score.txt file to my GitHub with  my last score in the game to show what it would look like when played.
