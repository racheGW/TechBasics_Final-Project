Characters explore a magic library, meeting mystical characters and traveling through different rooms of the enchanted library. 
Players solve mini puzzles and questions about their book preferences. 
Based on these the game recommends books that match their taste â€“ fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, self-help. 
It is a 2D interactive adventure game that will be built with python and pygame. 

# Final Choice for Game and Design of Final Project

Original Idea and Limitations: 
I originally wanted to create a recommendation system for books, where the recmmendation would be based on a series of questions the player would answer. However, as I started thinking about the system and how I wanted to design it I realized that I prefered the idea of creating an actual game. 

# Final Idea: 
I researched basic game structures I could make with pygame and found a video that explained how to use graphical user interface for a pong game. Therfore I decided to code a platformer game similar to classical games. However I still wanted to include some pieces of my original idea with the bright and playful color scheme.

# Refrences: 
The video I used to help my coding was very usefull when trying to figure out what errors I had made. It also provided helpful resources for my game design. The step by step instructions gave helpful tips for my project. It also provided me with little tricks I did not know before that I could use.

# Development process and challenges: 
Initially I had some trouble with getting into the rythym of coding something of this size. I found it hard to keep an overview of what tasks I still had to do to make the code work. It was frustrating finding small errors that, were usually just an oversight, like a mispelled word, etc. AT first I had all these ideas of what i wanted to add graphicaly but in the end I relized I was too focused on these design elements. Instead I settled on a project that would challenge me, while still being managable. 
When developing the game I had some challnges, for example when it came to how the player moved their paddle.  At first I struggled with how the paddle would stay on screen. The video offered an helpful explanation for this. 
I also had to research and test out how to get the ball to move at random, and not just always in one direction (or in the worst case not at all). It was also interesting to test how to keep the ball on screen.

Another thing I focused on was collision and how to code that. It was also intersting working with inheritance and how to code that properly after having done so in class a while ago. Additionaly for the game I wanted to have some way to save the games progress. Eventually through some trial and error I figured out how to do that using a text file. To do this I used JSON. I also added a delay to when the ball starts moving to improve gameplay.

# Future improvements and known limitations
For the future I would like to be more creative with my graphics. I found a lot of interesting designs but realized my skill level did not yet match what I would need to do to and edit those graphics for my game. While researching for my project I also found other ideas I found really interesting, for example a GitHub also had a Stardew Valley inspired Game using pygame. For the future I would try and figure out how that could work.
