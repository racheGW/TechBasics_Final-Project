Documentation for Final Project "Library Quest"

I originally wanted to create a recommendation system for books, where the recoomendation would be based on a series of questions the player would answer. However, as I started thinking about the system and how i wanted to design it I realized that I prefered the idea of creating an actual game. 
I researched basic game structures I could make with pygame and found a video that explained how to use graphical user interface for a plattformer game. Therfore i decided to code a platformer game similar to classical Mario Games. However I still wanted to include some pieces of my original idea. That is why I let my platformer game be inspired by a library. 
The video I used to help my coding was very usefull when trying to figure out what errors i had made. It also provided helpful resources for my game design.
