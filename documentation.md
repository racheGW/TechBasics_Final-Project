![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d02297a8-7bf5-42ea-acdd-efe194964ded)
Characters explore a magic library, meeting mystical characters and traveling through different rooms of the enchanted library. 
Players solve mini puzzles and questions about their book preferences. 
Based on these the game recommends books that match their taste â€“ fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, self-help. 
It is a 2D interactive adventure game that will be built with python and pygame. 

# Final Choice for Game and Design of Final Project

Original Idea and Limitations: 
I originally wanted to create a recommendation system for books, where the recoomendation would be based on a series of questions the player would answer. However, as I started thinking about the system and how I wanted to design it I realized that I prefered the idea of creating an actual game. 

Final Idea: 
I researched basic game structures I could make with pygame and found a video that explained how to use graphical user interface for a plattformer game. Therfore I decided to code a platformer game similar to classical Mario games. However I still wanted to include some pieces of my original idea. That is why I let my platformer game be inspired by a library. 

Refrences: 
The video I used to help my coding was very usefull when trying to figure out what errors i had made. It also provided helpful resources for my game design. 

Development process and challenges: 
Initially I had some trouble with getting into the rythym of coding something of this size. I found it hard to keep an overview of what tasks I still had to do to make the code work. It was frustrating finding small errors that, where usually just an oversight, like a mispelled word, etc. 

Future improvements and known limitations
